# Medical Security News

### A news congregator for all of the latest cybersecurity news in the healthcare industry.

## Description
This project serves as a small sample of my ability to develop a web application front end quickly using React components.
As the title mentions, this news congregator utilizes the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to serve the most recent articles in the healthcare security industry in the past 6 months, of course, with a focus on medical device security

I elected to use React.ts to learn more about how data types can make frontend development more succinct and robust. 

### What's next?
Since this is a demo project, it will not be in active as of right now, however many features could easily be added to the UI to give it a better user experience.
Things that could be included are the following:

- A simple way to filter articles by various parameters such as title, date, or author.
- A search bar to be able to quickly search for a specific article.
- A sticky scroll up button that appears once user scroll below the initial fold of the page.
- Many other features
